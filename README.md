A productivity tool for intensive working sessions

Work for 3 hours, divided into 70,50, and 30 minute chunks with 10 minute breaks in between. An alarm will ring to signal a break, and when it is time to transition to the next work session. A colourful surprise awaits those who make it to the end. Hope you have a productive session.
